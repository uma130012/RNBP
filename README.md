  - **components:** Reusable UI components.
  - **navigation:** Navigation setup and configurations.
  - **screens:** App screens and their components, and every components folder contains:
    - `screenName.tsx`: _The TypeScript file for the component._
    - `model.d.ts`: _The file would typically define the expected structure and types of data that your application expects from the API._
    - `style.ts`: _The styles for the component._
    - `helper.ts`: _Any helper functions related to the component._
  - **redux:** Redux store, actions, and reducers.
  - **services:** Network services, Socket services.
